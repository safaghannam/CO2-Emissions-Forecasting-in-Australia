# CO₂ Emissions Forecasting in Australia

# An Explainable Comparative Study of Statistical, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Hybrid Models for CO₂ Emissions Forecasting in Australia
*by Dr. Safa Ghannam*  
This repository provides a reproducible Python implementation of thirteen forecasting models—including statistical, machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches—for national CO₂ emissions in Australia (1982–2022). It includes explainable insights using SHAP and scenario analyses. All code and instructions are provided to reproduce the results presented in the corresponding manuscript submitted to Array Journal.


## Data
All datasets used in this study are publicly available:

- **Our World in Data (OWID) CO₂ and greenhouse gas emissions:** [https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)  
- **Australian Energy Update 2024:** [https://www.energy.gov.au/publications/australian-energy-update-2024](https://www.energy.gov.au/publications/australian-energy-update-2024)

### Data Usage
Although the datasets contain many variables, this study uses **22 selected factors** covering energy consumption, fossil fuel use, electricity generation, economic output, population dynamics, and land-use change CO₂ emissions. These variables serve as input features for all forecasting models. Users running the code should ensure these 22 factors are available from the original sources.

**Summary of Key Influencing Factors:**

| Factor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| CO₂ emissions | Mt CO₂ | Total carbon dioxide emissions |
| Total greenhouse gas emissions excluding land use change | Mt CO₂-e | Total GHG emissions excluding land-use change and forestry |
| Gross Domestic Product (GDP) | Billion AUD | Total market value of goods and services produced |
| Consumption (Total Energy Consumption) | PJ | Total energy used across all energy types |
| Electricity supply | PJ | Total electricity supplied |
| Coal consumption | PJ | Energy from coal consumption |
| Gas consumption | PJ | Energy from natural gas consumption |
| Oil consumption | PJ | Energy from oil consumption |
| Transport energy consumption | PJ | Energy used specifically for transport |
| Energy growth in Queensland | PJ | Annual growth of energy consumption in Queensland |
| Energy growth in the rest of Australia | PJ | Annual growth excluding QLD and NT |
| Energy growth in Northern Territory | PJ | Annual growth in Northern Territory |
| Total generation | PJ | Total energy generation from all sources |
| Residential energy consumption | PJ | Energy consumed by the residential sector |
| Commercial energy consumption | PJ | Energy consumed by the commercial sector |
| Renewable energy | PJ | Total renewable energy produced |
| Renewable energy generation | GWh | Renewable energy used for electricity generation |
| Net energy exports | PJ | Energy exports minus imports |
| Population growth | Million people | Annual change in population |
| Energy intensity | GJ per million AUD | Energy per unit GDP |
| Energy productivity | GDP per PJ | Economic output per unit of energy |
| Land use change CO₂ emissions | Mt CO₂-e | CO₂ emissions from land-use change activities |
| Energy Consumption | TWh | Total electricity consumption in the national electricity market |

## Models Implemented
A total of **13 forecasting models** were implemented and evaluated:

1. Random Forest Regressor (RF)  
2. XGBoost Regressor  
3. Stacking Regressor (RF + XGBoost with Linear Regression meta-estimator)  
4. Enhanced Stacking Regressor (RF + XGBoost + SVR)  
5. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
6. ARIMA  
7. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)  
8. ISSA-ELM  
9. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  
10. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)  
11. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
12. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  
13. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  

### Model Evaluation
- **Training and validation:** Data from **1982 to 2015** was used. For each random seed, an **80/20 split** was applied internally to create training and validation sets for model tuning.  
- **Testing:** A separate dataset from **2016 to 2022** was used exclusively for evaluating model generalization on unseen data.  
- Each model was run **30 times with different random seeds** to ensure robust performance.  
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed for tree-based models, SVR, MLP, and sequence models.  

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R-squared (R²)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  
- Mean Squared Log Error (MSLE)  
- Median Absolute Error (MedAE)  

These metrics are widely used in emissions forecasting literature and provide complementary perspectives on model performance.
